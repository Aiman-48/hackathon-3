Frontend Enhancements
User Authentication:

Allow customers to create accounts and log in to save their orders and preferences.
Use JWT for authentication and secure session management.
Search and Filtering:

Add product search functionality (e.g., by name or category).
Filters for product attributes (e.g., price range, availability).
Wishlist/Favorites:

Allow customers to add products to a wishlist for future purchases.
Mobile-Friendly Features:

Add sticky navigation and call-to-action buttons optimized for mobile users.
  
Sanity CMS Enhancements
Categories and Subcategories:

Structure products into hierarchical categories for better organization.

{ name: 'category', type: 'document', fields: [
  { name: 'name', type: 'string', title: 'Category Name' },
  { name: 'parent', type: 'reference', to: [{ type: 'category' }], title: 'Parent Category' }
] }
Customer Schema:

Create a schema to store customer profiles (name, email, purchase history, etc.).
Reviews and Ratings:

Allow customers to leave reviews for products and rate them.

{ name: 'review', type: 'document', fields: [
  { name: 'product', type: 'reference', to: [{ type: 'product' }], title: 'Product' },
  { name: 'customer', type: 'reference', to: [{ type: 'customer' }], title: 'Customer' },
  { name: 'rating', type: 'number', title: 'Rating (1-5)' },
  { name: 'comment', type: 'text', title: 'Review Comment' }
] }


Sanity CMS:

Acts as the database for products, orders, and user data.
Third-Party APIs:

Handles payment processing and shipment tracking.
Draft Architecture:

[Frontend (Next.js)]
    |
    --> [Sanity CMS] --> [Products API]
    |
    --> [Third-Party APIs] --> [Shipment Tracking API / Payment Gateway]
  
API Enhancements
Authentication APIs:

/login: For user login.
/register: For new user registration.
/logout: To securely end sessions.
Advanced Cart Management:

/cart/add: Add items to the cart.
/cart/update: Update item quantity.
/cart/remove: Remove items.
Order Tracking:

/orders/:id: Retrieve details for a specific order (products, status, estimated delivery).
Scalability Considerations
Performance Optimization:

server-side caching for API responses (e.g., products, categories).
 lazy loading for images and code splitting for better load times.

  API Requirements
Hereâ€™s an example list of API endpoints:

Endpoint	Method	Purpose	Response Example
/products	GET	Fetch all product listings	{ "id": 1, "name": "Milk", "price": 100, "stock": 20 }
/product/:id	GET	Fetch single product details	{ "id": 1, "name": "Milk", "price": 100, "stock": 20 }

/shipment/:orderId	GET	Fetch shipment tracking details for an order	{ "status": "In Transit", "ETA": "15 mins" }
  
Database Relationships:

Optimize your Sanity structure for querying related documents (e.g., products linked to categories, orders linked to customers).
UI/UX Features
Dynamic Pricing:

Show discounts and promotional pricing.
Highlight "Limited Stock" or "Fresh Today" badges.
Real-Time Updates:

Use WebSockets for cart updates and order status tracking in real-time.
Personalization:


Analytics Integration:

Security Considerations
Payment Security:

Ensure proper encryption (e.g., HTTPS) and PCI compliance.

Sanitize inputs and validate data for both backend and frontend.
Role-Based Access Control:

Protect admin routes and sensitive data with proper user role
